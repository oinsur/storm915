                    <p>Our girls actively engage with elementary and middle school-aged girls, providing one-on-one mentorship and assisting them in developing their own soccer skills. This initiative not only benefits the mentees but also fosters leadership qualities and a sense of responsibility within our own team members.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, we firmly believe in cultivating financial responsibility and independence in our players. As part of our program, our girls actively participate in the fundraising process, learning essential skills related to financial management and resourcefulness. By involving them in this aspect, we aim to equip them with vital life skills that will serve them well beyond their soccer journey.</p>
